CRT v2 Deep: Recursive Transformer with Intermediate Supervision
A novel, highly efficient language model architecture leveraging recursive computation and convolutional refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accelerated inference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository provides the complete training and implementation pipeline for the CRT v2 Deep model, a cutting-edge deep recursive transformer. The architecture uniquely combines Layer Recursion (parameter sharing) with TRM recursive reasoning, optimized specifically for deep computation on resource-limited GPUs.
The implementation is designed as a single-cell training system for maximum reproducibility, compatible with environments like Google Colab.
Key Innovations
The CRT v2 Deep model introduces several novel concepts resulting in superior efficiency and quality:
• Recursive Architecture with Parameter Sharing: The model employs a depth of 8 recursive loops, applying a single shared block multiple times to achieve high depth. This results in a significantly lower parameter count compared to traditional, non-recursive deep transformers.
• Intermediate Supervision (Critical Finding): The architecture includes auxiliary prediction heads placed at intermediate loops (specifically, Loops 2, 4, and 6 in the optimal configuration). This supervision technique serves as a regulariser.
• Optimised Performance via Early Exit: A critical finding demonstrated that the model's intermediate layers consistently outperform the final 8-loop layer.
    ◦ Loop 6 is the optimal configuration, providing a best perplexity of 1.081, which is 2.2% better than the full model (1.105 PPL).
    ◦ This optimal configuration enables 1.33x faster inference speed while delivering better quality, representing a highly efficient deployment strategy.
• Convolutional TRM Blocks (TRM Blocks): The feedforward component uses Flexible ConvTRM Blocks, where a convolutional layer (specifically, the Conv+Linear TRM architecture proved highly effective) is embedded inside the recursive reasoning cycles, enhancing local pattern capture.
• TRM-Refined Embeddings: Token embeddings are refined using a short 3-cycle ConvTRM process before entering the main recursive loops.
• High Memory Efficiency: The system leverages techniques like Gradient Checkpointing and Mixed Precision (BFloat16/Float16) to enable the training of deep models on GPUs with limited VRAM (e.g., RTX 4050 6GB).
